Details about Role_Permissions file changes.txt

File Name: Export_Role_Permissions_Table.sql

Date Edited: 2024-08-14

Edited by: Rich Howland

The purpose of this editing session was to populate 
the role_permissions data table with explicit 
permissions data for all 12 roles and all 11 
permissions, resulting in 132 data rows. 

I am writing this detailed document because I do not 
have any experience working with the SQLite database 
and if I make a mistake, I will have documented that 
mistake so I will not repeat it in the future. 


Steps to make this change:
01 Before I edited this file, I made this copy: 
   Export_Role_Permissions_Table_backup_01.sql

02 Before I executed the revised sql statement, 
   I made this copy of the sqlite.db file:
   sqlite - Copy.db

03 I opened the sqlite.db database using th 
   SQLiteStudio v3.4.4 app.

04 I deleted the existing role_permissions data 
   table with this command: 
     DROP TABLE IF EXISTS role_permissions;

05 I copied the contents of the .sql file: 
      Export_Role_Permissions_Table.sql
   and pasted that contents into the Query 
   panel and clicked the blue arrow icon to 
   execute the sql script. 

   After clicking the blue arrow icon, a 
   "Query parameters" window appeared which I 
    captured with Snagit.

   At the top of the window this heading appeared: 
   "Please provide values for query parameters".

   Below the heading were four fields.  

   Using Notepad++ I searched the script for any
   '?', ':', or '@' characters that might be 
   coded incorrectly.  There are no '?' or '@' 
   characters.  There are numerous ':' characters 
   but all of them are either in comment lines 
   or are in date values contained in single 
   quote characters. 

   However, I DID FIND some coding errors where 
   some values were missing a closing apostrophe 
   and comma.  I fixed those errors, re-executed 
   the sql script and it worked OK. 

06 After executing the .sql statement that re-created 
   the role_permissions table, I ran a select query 
   and all 132 rows appeared.
