 * Question: Why was it necessary to create this component?
 * Answer  : This component was necessary to provide a dedicated page for user authentication. It ensures that authenticated users are redirected to the home page and displays the sign-in form for existing users to log in. 
 *
 * ------------------------------
 * Question: What does this component do?:
 * Answer  : This component checks if a user is already authenticated. If the user is authenticated, it redirects them to the home page. If the user is not authenticated, it renders a page with a sign-in form, allowing existing users to log in to their accounts.
